    - Committing changes to Git repository
    - Deploying to Vercel with production flag
  - Made script executable with `chmod +x deploy.sh`
  - Usage: `./deploy.sh` from project root

### Deployment Setup - [DATE]

- **Issue**: Setting up Vercel deployment with Supabase integration
- **Solution**: 
  - Created Supabase client configuration in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
  - Added Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`
  - Updated deployment documentation in README.md
  - Environment variables need to be configured in Vercel dashboard during deployment

### React Hydration Mismatch in AnimatedTestimonials - [2024-12-28]

- **Issue**: React hydration error in the AnimatedTestimonials component
  ```
  Error: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties.
  ```
  The error showed mismatched rotation values and opacity between server and client rendering.

- **Cause**: The component was using `Math.random()` in the `randomRotateY()` function to generate rotation values for testimonial cards. This caused different values to be generated on the server vs. client, leading to hydration mismatches.

- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced `Math.random()` with deterministic rotation values based on testimonial index
  - Created `getRotation(index)` function that uses a predefined array of rotation values
  - Used modulo operation to cycle through rotation values for any number of testimonials
  - This ensures consistent rendering between server and client

- **Files Changed**: `src/components/ui/animated-testimonials.tsx`

### Missing Team Images - [2024-12-28]

- **Issue**: 404 errors for team member images (`/team/person1.jpg`, `/team/person2.jpg`, etc.)
- **Cause**: Team directory was empty but component was referencing team member images
- **Solution**: 
  - Created placeholder SVG images for all 4 team members
  - Used simple avatar-style graphics with names
  - Placed in `public/team/` directory

## Previous Bug Fixes

### ESLint warnings about using `<img>` elements (2023-11-10)

**Issue:**
ESLint warnings when using standard HTML `<img>` elements in the Feature73 component:
```
Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` or a custom image loader to automatically optimize images.
```

**Cause:**
Next.js recommends using its optimized Image component for better performance and optimization rather than standard HTML img tags.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `<img>` elements with Next.js `<Image>` components
- Added `fill` property and made container `relative` to ensure proper layout
- Added `unoptimized` property since we're using external image URLs from placeholder services
- Adjusted CSS classes to work with the Next.js Image component

### ESLint warnings with Logos carousel (2023-11-20)

**Issue:**
ESLint warnings in the Logos3 component:
```
Error: 'Image' is defined but never used.  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />`.
```

**Cause:**
Import for `Image` was present but not used, and standard HTML `<img>` tags were used instead of Next.js Image components.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `<img>` elements with Next.js `<Image>` components with appropriate properties
- Set fixed dimensions with `fill` and `object-contain` for proper image display
- Used local image assets instead of external URLs

### React hydration errors with Next.js Link vs HTML anchor tags (2023-11-20)

**Issue:**
ESLint warning in the Footer component:
```
Error: Do not use an `<a>` element to navigate to `/`. Use `<Link />` from `next/link` instead.
```

**Cause:**
Using standard HTML anchor tags for internal navigation in a Next.js application can cause hydration issues and doesn't benefit from Next.js's client-side navigation optimizations.

**Solution:**
- Replaced HTML `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components for all internal navigation links
- Kept standard `<a>` tags for external links with `target="_blank"`

### React hydration mismatch with random values (2023-11-25)

**Issue:**
React hydration error in the GridPattern component:
```
Error: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties.
```

**Cause:**
The component was using `Math.random()` to generate patterns for decorative elements, causing mismatches between server-side rendering and client-side hydration. Random values should never be used during rendering in React applications with server-side rendering.

**Solution:**
- Replaced the random pattern generation with predefined patterns
- Used deterministic pattern selection based on feature properties
- Added pre-computed animation values for the BackgroundBeams component instead of using Math.random() during render
- Ensured consistent rendering between server and client 

### UI/UX Improvements based on Audit (2023-12-01)

**Issue:**
The homepage had several UX issues identified in a professional audit:
- Hero section had poor typography balance and text widths
- Feature cards looked static and lacked animation
- Industry section had duplicate content
- Missing required sections (Team, Testimonials)
- Navigation was not optimal for user experience

**Cause:**
Initial design focused on functionality rather than polish, and some PRD requirements were not fully implemented.

**Solution:**
- Improved Hero section with better text widths, typography, and button styling
- Added animations to Feature cards using Framer Motion
- Fixed Industry section's duplicate content and added animations
- Added Team and Testimonials sections
- Implemented a sticky navbar with scroll progress indicator
- Improved CTA section with better typography and button styling
- Added microinteractions like hover effects throughout the site

### Color inconsistency and styling issues (2023-12-02)

**Issue:**
The UI had inconsistent color usage, with hardcoded hex values spread throughout components, leading to maintenance issues and inconsistent visual styling.

**Cause:**
Lack of a centralized color system and CSS variables for consistent styling across components.

**Solution:**
- Added CSS variables for primary GP colors (--gp-primary, --gp-secondary, --gp-accent, --gp-light)
- Updated Tailwind configuration to use these variables (colors.gp.primary, etc.)
- Standardized typography with consistent text sizes and line heights
- Improved container width and padding for consistent layout
- Fixed inconsistent button styles with unified hover/focus states 

### Stakeholder UI Feedback Implementation (2023-12-10)

**Issue:**
Stakeholders requested specific UI changes to improve branding consistency and better visual hierarchy:
- Hero button needed to match the company's branding colors
- Industries section had inconsistent card designs compared to Solutions section
- CTA section needed color contrast improvements for better readability

**Cause:**
Visual inconsistencies between sections and deviation from brand guidelines.

**Solution:**
- Updated hero CTA button with black background and white text for better branding consistency
- Redesigned Industries section with uniform card layouts matching the Solutions section
- Adjusted CTA section with solid colors instead of gradients and removed hover effects for cleaner appearance
- Verified changes with successful build process to ensure no regressions 

### UI Layout and Color Standardization (2023-12-15)

**Issue:**
Multiple UI inconsistencies were found across the site:
- Inconsistent text colors and alignment in section headings
- Mixed border colors causing visual inconsistency
- Hero section had poor text contrast
- Inconsistent section layouts (centered vs. left-aligned)

**Cause:**
Gradual development without a consistent style guide applied to all components.

**Solution:**
- Fixed button text color in hero section for proper contrast
- Removed unnecessary "Эксперты, стоящие за трансформацией..." text from hero
- Standardized border colors to light gray (--gp-border) throughout the site
- Created consistent text color system (--gp-primary for headings, --gp-text-gray for body text)
- Converted all section headings to left-aligned layout with consistent styling
- Fixed ESLint error with unused AnimatedContainer import
- Verified all changes with successful build

### Logos Section Design Issue (2023-12-20)

**Issue:**
The logos section used a carousel design that was not appropriate for only two logos (QazCode and VEON). This created visual issues:
- Carousel looked empty and broken with large spaces
- Animation felt unnecessary for only two items
- Poor visual rhythm on the page

**Cause:**
The design was initially created for 5-6 logos, but the actual implementation only had two logos available.

**Solution:**
- Completely redesigned the logos section from carousel to "Centered Duo" layout
- Made logos larger (height increased from 14px to 20px)
- Added proper heading "Нам доверяют" with better styling
- Improved hover effects with grayscale-to-color transition
- Added descriptive text below the logos to add context
- Added accessibility improvements with proper aria-labels
- Fixed ESLint error related to unused heading parameter
- Verified the solution with successful build 

### Premium UI Upgrade for Industries Section (2023-12-25)

**Issue:**
The Industries section had several UI/UX issues identified in an Apple-style design audit:
- Cards had inconsistent heights due to varying text lengths
- Image-based design lacked brand consistency and premium feel
- Limited hover effects and micro-interactions
- Poor spacing and alignment in header section
- Border styling was too heavy and didn't match the Apple-inspired aesthetic
- Four-column layout created uneven spacing on wider screens

**Cause:**
The component was built with a traditional approach not fully aligned with the Apple-style premium design guidelines in the PRD.

**Solution:**
- Created custom SF Symbols-inspired vector icons for each industry
- Implemented a more balanced 3-column grid layout
- Developed a dedicated IndustryCard component with proper hover effects
- Added staggered Framer Motion animations for smooth scroll reveals
- Applied line-clamp to ensure consistent text heights
- Enhanced typography with better spacing and sizing
- Added two more industries to complete the grid (Manufacturing and Energy)
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Updated the color scheme with subtle hover transitions
- Replaced heavy borders with light rings for a more premium look
- Added the @tailwindcss/line-clamp plugin for consistent text truncation

### Image Handling in Animated Testimonials (2023-12-30)

**Issue:**
Using external image URLs from Unsplash in the AnimatedTestimonials component resulted in Next.js Image component errors:
```
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /testimonials/person1.jpg received text/html; charset=utf-8
```

**Cause:**
Next.js Image component has domain restrictions for external images and requires special handling for images from external domains.

**Solution:**
- Added the `unoptimized` property to the Image component when using external URLs
- Implemented a condition to check if the image source starts with "http" to apply the unoptimized flag
- Updated color schemes to use the global GP color variables (text-gp-primary, text-gp-text-gray)
- Adjusted the navigation buttons to use the brand's light background and primary text colors
- Fixed ESLint dependency warnings in the useEffect hooks by using useCallback for handler functions
- Updated the testimonials content to use proper English text for international visitors
